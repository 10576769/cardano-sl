This document covers changes introduced to CSL under version 0.6.
List is compiled taking version 0.5 as base version.

## Important consensus improvements/fixes

Number of important improvements and fixes where introduced for block/transaction processing,
LRC (Leader & Richmen computation).

These fixes include:
* Providing required check for paper invariants (CSL-554)
* Doing some sanity checks for code to not to fall into wrong state of execution

Including:
* Improvements for keygen tool (genesis block data and secret key generator)
* Block-gen tool (artificial blockchain generator, for testing purposes)
* Improvements to code base to allow CSL to be run with mainnet constants
   * Including improvements for block retrieval speed, which needs to be moderately high to allow us to use 20s block

### Issue list

* CSL-1295 Reliable headers negotiation on `recoveryMessageHeaders: 10000`

## Transaction fee

This is a new feature was implemented from scratch according to paper.

In v0.6 (Byron) we support only checking transactions contain sufficient amount of fees to pass minimal threshold.
This is a requirement for DDOS protection. Withdrawing fees by participants of protocol is feature planned
for further release (Shelley). Fees collected on Byron will be available for withdrawal with later version of CSL.

### Issue list

* CSL-1240 Introduce `transactionFeePolicy`
* CSL-1242 Check transaction fee is above limit
* CSL-1461 Allow redemption transaction without transaction fee
* CSL-1518 Check we have fees set in lovelaces

## Serialization

CSL uses binary protocols to establish communication between nodes. There is a lot of data circulating thus choice
of serialization library is very important.

Previously we used `binary` package which wasn't performant enough (also was subject to memory leaks).

Decision was made to make switch to different serialization library. Initially `store` library was chosen,
code refactored accordingly, though later we understood `store` is not the best choice for us due to its formats
and unsustainability to possible attacks.

Finally, the `cborg` library was chosen because it provides nice formats with reasonable performance and guarantees of
sustainability against malicious actors.

### Issue list

* CSL-721 Revise usage of AsBinary and idea of delayed parsing in general
* CSL-1122 Rewrite serialization on `store`
* CSL-1296 Review and Finalise Serialisation Format
* CSL-1412 Check length while deserializing `AsBinary`
* CSL-1445 Add a mechanism to print the target type in case of a deserialise failure (the same way `Bi.label` was doing)
* CSL-1447 Investigate if we can remove CRC32 from addresses
* CSL-1448 deriveSimpleBi is using `def`, but it should throw an error instead
* CSL-1478 Switch to upstream revision of `cborg`
* CSL-1493 Get rid of unsafe deserialize and deserialize'
* CSL-1494 Serialize CBOR with tag 24
* CSL-1504 decodeAbstractHash is broken
* CSL-1517 Instance Bi Coin doesn't check bounds correctly

## Refactoring

Cardano SL is rather huge project, code base contains tens and hundreds of modules, functions etc.

We aim for CSL code to be a logically consistent construction which you can reason about and which is
reasnoably easy to extend. To keep project in proper shape we perform various refactorings when we start to feel need to.
They don't introduce any new feature, but allow us to keep going on implementing new features.

Some of refactorings performed not only restructured code, but also allowed us to discover some bugs hidden
in not-perfectly-structured code.

### Issue list

* CSL-755 Extract Pos.DB
* CSL-775 Refactor initialization (Runner/Scenario)
* CSL-781 Try adding per-executable switch to cabal file

* CSL-1536 Replace `putMVar` with `tryPutMVar` in `newInitFuture` and update comment

## Network subsystem

The network subsystem has been substantially extended with features to improve
stability, performance and functionality. This includes:

 * improved support for wallets behind NAT or firewalls

 * improved DDoS protection with firewalled core and public relay nodes
 * scalable relay groups to manage load or mitigate DDoS attacks
 * near-optimal static routing topologies with backup routes

## Stats and metrics

Also CSL is packed with facility of sending logs to so-called reporting server.

Within v0.6:

* Work was performed to analyse stats gathered on current testnets (with use of reporting server).
* Additional metrics are being reported now

## SCRAPE

A key feature introduced in v0.6 is SCRAPE: a new algrithm for SSC (Shared seed computation).
It significantly improvemnt Cardano SL scalability, removing quadratic complexity
from GOD (Guaranteed Output Delivery) tossing algorithm.

Yet it doesn't mean CSL supports arbitrary amount of participants for SSC,
it still should be reviewed and refined from networking requirements.
But this is a major improvement already.

### Issue list

## Testing

Significant effort was put on property-based testing.

Following functionality was covered with tests (all were developed from scratch):
* Block processing (with transaction payloads)
* LRC
* Shares distribution

Tests for block processing were implemented with use of specifically developed framework for constructing and running scnearious,
which address various blockchain events (such as fork and branch selection). This framework will be used for further test coverage
(work is only started, we covered only the most important stuff).
