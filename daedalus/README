== INSTALL ==

`npm install`

== RUN ==

If you want to run manually `bower` or `pulp` then export `export PATH=$PATH:node_modules/.bin/`

You don't have to export anything if you use these through npm. Look at package.json scripts for common commands.

== DEBUG ==

```bash
npm start
open http://localhost:3000/
# open console of Browser to check results
```
